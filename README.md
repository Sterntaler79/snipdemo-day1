# Snip CLI

A zero-dependency Node.js command-line client for the Snip URL shortener API.
Requires Node.js 20 or newer.

```sh
node cli.js help
node cli.js add https://example.com
node cli.js ls
node cli.js open <code>
```

Set `SNIP_API` to use a different backend origin; it defaults to
`http://localhost:3000`. After installing this package, the `snip` command is
available from its `bin` entry. The `snip`, `snip.cmd`, and `snip.ps1` wrappers
can also be run directly from this folder.
